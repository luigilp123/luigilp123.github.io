    <p><span class="bold">Aim: </span></p>
        <p>
            To investigate England's North-South divide, using data visualization to explore regional disparities.
        </p>
    <p><span class="bold">Motivation: </span></p>
         <p>
        These disparities has been a recent topic of concern. Traditionally, the South is seen as more prosperous, while the North has struggled with higher poverty and unemployment. This project will highlight some of these differences. I hope to draw attention to the divide and encourage discussion about regional inequality in England. Understanding the North-South divide is the fist step in developing targeted solutions to reduce the gap.
        </p>
    <p><span class="bold">Note: </span></p>
        <p>
            For simplicity, this project defines the South as: The East, South-East, South-West, and London.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Some charts in the project are colour coded according to location. Fig5 and fig7 divide in two, with 'North' including the Midlands. Fig1 colour codes according to three divisions: South, Midlands, North.

            GDP, often used as an indicator of prosperity and economic activity, measures economic output.

        <p>
            The South (purple) makes up for a far higher share of England's total GDP than the North (green).

    <p>
        In general, regions with higher educational attainment have higher GDHIs. This holds accross a range of qualifications. London and the South-East have the highest GDHI. In all qualifications, except GCSEs, London leads in terms of attainment and is followed by the South-East. The charts suggest that the impacts of educational disparities stretch beyond academic success and may contribute to disparities in living standards.

    <p>
        Crime is highest in the three northernmost regions. In the South, London stands out as a high crime area. However, the rate is still below that of the West midlands and the North. The South-West has the lowest crime rate.

      <p><span class="bold">Conclusion:</span>
        <p>
            This project highlights the economic disparities between the North and South of England, which are driven largely by London and the South-East. Figure 1 shows that southern regions accounted for 62% of total 2020 GDP. London alone accounted for 27%, more than the combined total of the three northern regions (22%). We also see that the North has lower GDP per capita, which typically indicates lower incomes, employment, and standards of living. Figure 5 confirms that incomes are generally higher in the south. However, we observe that London has experienced relatively high unemployment since 1992. 
       </p>
        <p>
            Figure 4 finds an education gap, with the South generally having higher educational attainment. This may contribute to the economic differences we observe. We explore a relationship between education and GDHI, finding a positive correlation. This suggests that the North-South economic disparities may be, in part, due to educational variation. Improving education may help to reduce the gap. A regression of education on other economic indicators would be useful in further investigating this. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Figure 7 shows areas with high life expectancy and high GDP per capita tend to be southern and finds a positive relationship between these variables, suggesting that economic prosperity is in some way related to health. Another finding is that crime rates are higher in the north, possibly  due to lower incomes, employment, education and prosperity.
